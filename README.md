SIDE THEORY ABOUT THE VACUUM OF SPACE AND BLACK HOLES IN GENERAL...

Interesting thing about the actual "vacuum of space"
the empty VOID of space itself might be a type of "chemical structure" even though it doesn't seem to make sense as an empty "VOID" of nothingness...

black holes when they form actually swirl in a twisting motion like a physical dense liquid even though space itself is not compromised of a physical "liquid"

when space-time bends from enough gravity its almost like the same motion of "space-time" bending in an oceanic whirlpool

almost like when water goes down the drain on a small scale it creates a mini swirling "whirlpool" with the liquid

even on a larger scale in the ocean when a whirlpool forms in the ocean's currents its a liquid mass that is spinning around and twirling around like a liquid tornado.

SO VERY SIMILAR PHYSICAL REACTION WITH DENSE AMOUNTS OF OUTER SPACE WHEN A BLACK HOLE FORMS.......

FROM INTENSE ENERGY AND GRAVITY A BLACK HOLE STARTS TO PHYSICALLY ALMOST RESEMBLE THE SAME FLUID MOTION OF AN OCEAN WHIRLPOOL TWISTING AND BENDING FROM GRAVITY IN AN EXTREME FORM IN THE DEPTHS OF OUTER SPACE


IT COULD BE POSSIBLE THAT THE ACTUAL FABRIC OF THE VACUUM OF SPACE IS A TYPE OF UNKNOWN CHEMICAL STRUCTURE THAT THE HUMAN RACE CANT SCIENTIFICALLY UNDERSTAND AT THE MOMENT WITH OUR LIMITATIONS OF EARLY SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE WITH OUR SCIENTIFIC EVOLUTION ONLY BEING LESS THAN 200 YEARS IN MODERN EXISTENCE..........
